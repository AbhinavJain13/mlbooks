# Best Machine Learning Books

This [git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/) repository collates
freely available online books on various sub-fields of Machine
Learning.  It doesn't physically contain any of them, but rather
contains references to original websites, from which you could fetch
them using git-annex.  For instance

	git clone git://github.com/datalad/mlbooks
	cd mlbooks
    git annex get *.pdf

would fetch all the books available as a .pdf file.
